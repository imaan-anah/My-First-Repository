1. The layout needs to work as follows (look at the image for reference)

1a .block--sextuple -
  100% width on mobile
  3 in a row on tablet
  6 in a row on desktop

1b .block--quadruple -
  100% width on mobile
  2 in a row on tablet
  4 in a row on desktop

1c .block--triple -
  100% width on mobile
  the FIRST TWO blocks 2 in a row on tablet
  the LAST block 100% width on tablet (think pseudo-classes...)
  3 in a row on desktop

1d .block--double -
  100% width on mobile
  two in a row on tablet AND desktop (you only need to enter this in one place)

2. Then use pseudo-classes to turn the background of FIRST child of each block type white, and the text colour to be red.
  -- HINT: You will need to use the parent class (the row) to do the above

3. Comment out your code and try to reverse this to be desktop first so that you understand the difference between breakpoint syntax
  - Think... mobile first (desktop second) uses MIN-WIDTH 
  - Think... desktop first (mobile second) uses MAX-WIDTH
